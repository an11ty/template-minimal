# An11ty Minimal Template

This template is an absolutely minimal template for use
with [an11ty](https://github.com/an11ty/an11ty), with as
few dependencies and parts as possible.

If you are looking for a more feature-complete template
to use, you should check out the
[default an11ty template](https://github.com/an11ty/template) instead.

## Folder Structure

are no "includes".

contains documentation or other non-public assets.

This folder contains the site content and configuration files.

### `/src/_data`

This folder holds data that is then accessible inside templates.

### `/src/layouts`

This folder holds the single site layout.
